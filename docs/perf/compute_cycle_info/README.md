Compute Cycle Info — Performance Artifacts

Location for committed JSON artifacts generated by the `compute_cycle_info` micro-benchmark.

Include at least one canonical latest artifact per runner/device profile. Use the naming convention:

- compute_cycle_info_<YYYY-MM-DD>_<device-or-runner>.json

Required JSON fields:
- timestamp: ISO 8601
- device: { model, os, cpu, memory }
- build: { flutter, dart, mode }
- warmup: number
- samples: number
- p50: number (ms)
- p95: number (ms)
- p99: number (ms)
- deviations: string[] (notes on deviations from the reference device/build)

Example:
{
  "timestamp": "2025-03-30T21:15:00Z",
  "device": { "model": "Apple M1", "os": "macOS 14.5", "cpu": "8-core", "memory": "16GB" },
  "build": { "flutter": "3.35.4", "dart": "3.5.4", "mode": "release" },
  "warmup": 100,
  "samples": 10000,
  "p50": 8.7,
  "p95": 12.9,
  "p99": 16.4,
  "deviations": []
}
