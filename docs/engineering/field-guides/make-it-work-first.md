# THE MAKE IT WORK FIRST FIELD GUIDE

## CORE TRUTH
Defensive code before functionality is theater.
Prove it works. Then protect it.

## THE RULES
1. Build the Happy Path First – Code that DOES the thing
2. No Theoretical Defenses – Naked first version
3. Learn from Real Failures – Fix reality, not ghosts
4. Guard Only What Breaks – Add checks only for facts
5. Keep the Engine Visible – Action, not paranoia

## ANTI-PATTERNS TO BURN
❌ Fortress Validation
❌ Defensive Exit Theater
❌ Connection State Paranoia

## PATTERNS TO LIVE BY
✅ Direct Execution
✅ Natural Failure
✅ Continuous Progress

## THE TEST
Can someone grok your code in 10 seconds?
YES → You lived the manifesto
NO  → Delete defenses

## THE PROMISE
Readable. Debuggable. Maintainable. Honest.

## THE METAPHOR
Don't bolt on airbags before the engine runs.
First: make it move.
Then: guard against real crashes.

MAKE IT WORK FIRST.
MAKE IT WORK ALWAYS.
GUARDS EARN THEIR KEEP.

## LUVI Leitplanke (nicht verhandelbar)
Engine darf nackt laufen — **Daten nie**.  
Consent/RLS/Secrets sind **immer** aktiv. Guards werden **nach realen Fehlern** ergänzt (Sentry/PostHog), nicht aus Theorien.
