Supabase is initialized via `SupabaseService` and only the login flow currently reaches the backend (`auth.signInWithPassword`) while signup, password reset, OTP confirmation, and consent edge-function telemetry remain UI stubs; the sole consent integration (`log_consent`) lacks session guards and test coverage, CLI access to `consents`/`profiles` schema and RLS data is blocked because `supabase db query` is unavailable in CLI 2.40.7 and no access token is configured, yet `flutter analyze` and the 90-test suite both pass, so the immediate wins are wiring the missing auth handlers to Supabase, adding consent error handling, and rerunning DB inspections once credentials or compatible tooling are provided.
