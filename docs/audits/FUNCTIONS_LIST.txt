# Token Error Guidance (Generated via Supabase CLI)
#
# Generation context:
#   - Created when `supabase functions list` runs without an access token during
#     audit automation jobs (see `docs/audits/` workflow notes).
#   - Logged as part of CI drift checks to highlight missing local Supabase
#     credentials while keeping the command output reviewable in git.
# Usage:
#   - Follow the message below to authenticate (`supabase login`) or export the
#     `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` before re-running the command.
#   - Once credentials are configured, regenerate the artifact to confirm access
#     succeeds and update this file as needed.
#
Access token not provided. Supply an access token by running supabase login or setting the SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable.
Try rerunning the command with --debug to troubleshoot the error.
